Current Version: 2.0

v2.0
The initial point of this remake was to add a few core features for
this project. Following will track my progress in this remake.

created gorajo.js, an alternative bot script to implement the following changes.

created config.json
    added vars: token, db_uri, applicationid, guildid, prefix
        config hosts server-sided settings, but it also hosts global
        references to private information stored in the .env file.
        The security of this method is unknown and should be verified.

handleEvents remained untouched.

handleCommands now has the token, applicationid, and guildid, properly
    referenced via the config file.
